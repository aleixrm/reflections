When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to made the code available from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because you may not want to have the latest version of the repository (maybe it will crash the changes that are you doing), or you want to avoid conflicts.
