When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	When you want to made the code available from anywhere.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Because you may not want to have the latest version of the repository (maybe it will crash the changes that are you doing), or you want to avoid conflicts.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A clone is a copy of a repository (local or remote). A fork is a clone of the another's github remote repository on a new github remote repository of your own. A branch is a duplication of the set of objects that are under version control, which posterior commits are made in parallel from the other branches and differs until a merge is done.
